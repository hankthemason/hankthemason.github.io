      <p>Hi!  I'm a mission-driven full-stack developer specializing in React/Typescript/Node.  I recently graduated from Recurse Center (fka: Hacker School) where I worked on several full-stack web apps, studied algorithms/data structures, and tried to get a lot better at this thing we call programming.</p>
